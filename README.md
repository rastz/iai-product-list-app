# Product list App for IAI

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and uses React with TypeScript.

This project provides two versions of the product list, each with a different approach to table management:

- React Table (located in `/react-table`): Utilizes the `@tanstack/react-table` library for table logic and state management.
